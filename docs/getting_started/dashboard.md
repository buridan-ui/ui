# Introduction
This walkthrough helps you scaffold the foundational layout for a dashboard-style Reflex app. While dashboards vary in content and complexity, their layout structure is almost always the same:

- A **sidebar** for navigation (often fixed)
- A **sticky sidebar header** for branding or profile info
- A **main content area**
- A **sticky content header** for search, filters, or page titles

This guide walks through building that exact foundation â€” a reusable layout skeleton you can plug your own pages and components into. Itâ€™s meant to save you time, enforce consistency, and give you a solid base to build from.

# Project Setup

To begin, create a new Reflex project using the CLI:

```bash
reflex init --name app
```

When prompted, select: **Blank Reflex App**
This will generate the following project structure:

```text
./
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ rxconfig.py
```

To run the development server and see the app in your browser, use:
```bash
reflex run
```

This will start a local server, usually at http://localhost:3000, where you can preview your dashboard as you build it.

# Creating the Main Layout Component

To keep your dashboard clean and maintainable, itâ€™s best to separate each layout section into its own component file.
Hereâ€™s a recommended structure for your `app/` directory:

```text
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ layout/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sidebar.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sidebar_header.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content_header.py

```

Weâ€™ll start by building the top-level layout component that wraps all other parts.

--SHOW_CODE_WITH_LANGUAGE(["dashboard_layout_example", "python"])--

Then in your `app.py`, use it as the root of your page:

--SHOW_CODE_WITH_LANGUAGE(["app_py_example", "python"])--

# Building the Sidebar

The sidebar is a key part of the dashboard layout. It typically contains navigation, branding, or user context and stays fixed on the left side of the screen. We'll start by creating a reusable `sidebar()` component inside `app/layout/sidebar.py`.

--SHOW_CODE_WITH_LANGUAGE(sidebar_example)--

- `rx.scroll_area(...)` lets the sidebar scroll independently if its content exceeds the viewport height.
- `sidebar_header()` is a separate component that we'll define next â€” it's used for a logo, app title, or profile section.
- The `rx.box(...)` inside is a vertical flex container for sidebar content like links, sections, or collapsible items.
- The `class_name` styling includes:
  - `sticky top-0`: Keeps the sidebar fixed on scroll.
  - `max-w-[300px]`: Limits the sidebar width.
  - Tailwind tweaks like `[&_.rt-ScrollAreaScrollbar]:...` adjust scrollbar margins and spacing inside Reflex's default scroll areas.

Next, weâ€™ll build the **sticky sidebar header** â€” a small top section inside the sidebar that stays fixed even when you scroll the rest of the sidebar contents.

# Adding the Sticky Sidebar Header

The sidebar header sits at the top of the sidebar and remains fixed while the rest of the sidebar content scrolls. It's ideal for branding, a dashboard title, or user profile info.

Here's the component definition:

--SHOW_CODE_WITH_LANGUAGE(["sidebar_header_example", "python"])--

Once this header is in place, your sidebar becomes more polished and ready for interactive content. Next, weâ€™ll focus on the main content area, including its own sticky header and scrollable body.


# Defining the Main Content Header

Just like the sidebar has a sticky top section, the main content area also benefits from a persistent header. This can hold breadcrumbs, context info, or action buttons relevant to the current page or dashboard section.

Hereâ€™s the header component:

--SHOW_CODE_WITH_LANGUAGE(["content_header_example", "python"])--

This header is used inside the scroll area of your `dashboard_layout()`. This ensures the content header stays in view as users scroll down the main area of the dashboard. Next, weâ€™ll create the actual main content section â€” where all your page content, cards, tables, and graphs will appear.

# Main Content Section: Where Everything Goes

With the layout now complete, this is where youâ€™ll add the actual content of your dashboard â€” charts, tables, cards, forms, and any interactive components. This content should go **inside the scrollable main area**, *beneath* the `content_header()`. In your `dashboard_layout()`, that means placing components after `content_header()` and before the end of the scroll area.

For example, if you have a chart or a card component, you would import it and place it like this:

--SHOW_CODE_WITH_LANGUAGE(["main_content_section_example", ""])--

# Final Words

You now have a clean, modular dashboard layout built with Reflex â€” complete with a sticky sidebar, a sticky main header, and a scrollable content area. This layout is designed to be reused across different pages or apps. Whether you're building a data dashboard, admin panel, or internal tool, the structure remains the same â€” giving you a rock-solid foundation to build on.

From here, you can:

- Start plugging in your actual dashboard content (charts, tables, forms).
- Add routing and navigation logic to move between pages.
- Customize styles, colors, and themes as needed.
- Extract reusable UI patterns to grow your component system.

This foundation keeps your layout logic clean and separate from your business logic â€” which means faster development and easier maintenance.

Happy building! ðŸš€
