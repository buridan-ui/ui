# Command Line Interface (CLI)

The Buridan UI CLI is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of adding components, wrapped React components, and themes to your Reflex project. It ensures that all necessary files are placed in the correct locations, making integration seamless.

## Installation

If you haven't already, install the Buridan UI CLI using pip:

```bash
pip install buridan-ui
```

## Usage Context

All `buridan` CLI commands must be run from the root directory of your Reflex project. This is typically the directory where your `rxconfig.py` file is located. The CLI uses this file to identify your project and its structure.

# Commands

# list

This command displays all available components, wrapped React components, and themes from the Buridan UI library. It's useful for discovering what's available before adding it to your project.

```bash
buridan list
```

**Example Output:**

```
Listing available items from repository...

--- Standard Components ---
- avatar
- badge
- button
# ... (more standard components) ...

--- Wrapped React Components ---
- react_countup
- simple_icon
# ... (more wrapped React components) ...

--- Themes ---
- amber
- blue
- gray
# ... (more themes) ...
```

# add

The `buridan add` command is used to bring specific items from the Buridan UI library into your project. It has several subcommands for different types of items.

## buridan add component <name>

Adds a standard Buridan UI component and its Python utility dependencies to your project.

```bash
buridan add component button
```

**Example:** To add the `button` component:

```bash
buridan add component button
```

This command will:
*   Ensure your local component library cache is up-to-date.
*   Validate that you are in a Reflex project.
*   Add the `button.py` component and its necessary utility dependencies (like `twmerge.py`) to your `your_app_name/components/ui/` directory.

## buridan add wrapped-react <name>

Adds a wrapped React component (a Python wrapper around a React component) and its Python utility dependencies to your project.

```bash
buridan add wrapped-react simple_icon
```

**Example:** To add the `simple_icon` wrapped React component:

```bash
buridan add wrapped-react simple_icon
```

This command will:
*   Ensure your local component library cache is up-to-date.
*   Validate that you are in a Reflex project.
*   Add the `simple_icon.py` component and its necessary utility dependencies to your `your_app_name/components/ui/` directory.

## buridan add theme <name>

Adds a CSS theme (including both light and dark variants) to your project's `assets/css/` directory.

```bash
buridan add theme blue
```

**Example:** To add the `blue` theme:

```bash
buridan add theme blue
```

This command will:
*   Ensure your local component library cache is up-to-date.
*   Validate that you are in a Reflex project.
*   Extract the `.theme-blue` and `.theme-blue-dark` CSS rules from the Buridan UI library.
*   Create an `assets/css/` directory in your project root (if it doesn't exist).
*   Save the extracted CSS into a new file named `blue.css` within `assets/css/`.

# Next Steps

After adding components or themes, you can import and use them in your Reflex application files. Refer to the specific component or theming documentation for usage examples.
